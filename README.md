# PiAlarm
Raspberry Pi Door/Window/Motion monitor program.

The GPIO pins are setup using the pipins.conf for pin assignment. This program is configured to use standard security system reed switches or other like devices. Each sensor is wired using ground (-) to the sensor then to a 1K resistor to the assigned pin on the GPIO. The schematic shows the general configuration of the sensors. It is still very much in early development. Any suggestions are welcome.
